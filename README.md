![Dynamic Weapon Profiles Screenshot](/screenshots/dwp_screenshot_1.jpg "Screenshot")

## What's New?
* Added knife and bolt thrower support
* Super Durable Knives checkbox
* Free Knife Repairs checkbox
* Combo boxes for ammo and reticle types
* Bug fixes

## Profiles
* Dynamic Weapon Profiles allows you to dynamically change the stats of all weapons by selecting the desired profile in a dropdown menu.
* The 'None' profile allows you to use the default Lua scripts as usual for [AWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/42) but still gain the benefits of dynamic stat changes and profile swapping. Extra Option checkboxes will dynamically apply to any profile. 
* [Better Weapon Balance](https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/490) is included by default as a profile. See below for details on stat changes.
* Profiles are modular, so you can create your own or download  profiles from Nexus and plug them into DWP.
* For documentation on creating your own profile mods, an updated tutorial covering the new live profile editor will soon be available in the [Modding Haven](https://discord.gg/modding-haven-718224210270617702) Discord. If you have further questions, that's also the fastest place to get in touch with me.
